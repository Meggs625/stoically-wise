### Summary
When a user first arrives to the application, they will be greeted by a landing page asking for a theme. The theme will be for what photos will appear with the quotes on the next page. Once a theme has been entered, upon selecting the "Enter" button, the user will navigate to a page displaying a random quote from a well known stoic philosopher. The background will be a photo of the theme selected on the previous page. 

If there is a quote or photo that speaks to the user, they can select the "+" button in the upper right hand corner of the quote card to store for later. Upon favoriting, a new random quote and photo will display for continued viewing. 

When the user has favorited quotes, they can view them by selecting the "View Favorites" link in the navigation bar. All saved quotes will render on this page. They are all stored in the localStorage of the user's machine to persist upon refresh. Should a user no longer wish to retain a quote, they can select the "-" button in the upper right hand side of the quote card to remove it from the page and storage. The user can navigate back to the quote page or to select a new theme in the navigation bar. 

After one theme has been selected, when the user returns to the landing page, a new button will appear with the option to get a quote with the same theme as requested prior.
